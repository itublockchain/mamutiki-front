# Getting Started

<p><b>Datagora</b> is a cutting-edge decentralized application (dApp) on the Movement Network, utilizing the <b>$DATA</b> token for efficient data exchanges. The name "<b>Datagora</b>" marries "Data" from English with "Agora," the ancient Greek term for a marketplace. It provides a powerful platform for researchers, companies, and independent developers—known as "<b>campaign creators</b>"—to launch data collection campaigns specifically for <b>AI training.</b> Whether the need is for health metrics, shopping receipts, or browsing behaviors, creators can specify data requirements and set quality standards. Participants contributing their data earn <b>$DATA</b> tokens, promoting a dynamic ecosystem. <b>Datagora</b> emphasizes data authenticity, privacy, and applies rigorous verification to ensure high-quality data, building trust among creators and contributors alike.</p>
